Hi there!

My name is Abilash Joseph Rajarethinam. 
I'm a teacher, game developer with keen interest in computer graphics and am working in the same technology.
Here I share my views on various topics ranging from politics, current affairs, constitution, education and much more. 
As C.N.Annadurai, founder of DMK and the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu told, I belong to the Dravidian stock and I am proud to call myself a Dravidian.
